Hello-World
===========

One of those noob repositories

I've come and joined the lovely Git-Hub universe to work with my LSL and OSSL scripts, and hopefully make my scripting smoother, more efficient and less resource hungry along the way... any thoughts, suggestions or tips/tricks that any other LSL/OSSL scripters would like to offer me to help in my journey will always be greatly appreciated!
